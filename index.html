                                <h2>Radha Krishnan Vinayagam</h2>
                                Latest technologies and new applications never cease to fascinate me. 
                                From my school days through university, I was an active international FIDE (World Chess Federation) rated chess player. 
                                This experience has instilled in me the admiration for human intelligence.
                                When I reached my college education, it naturally allured me towards Computer Science (machine intelligence).
                                With solid foundation in algorithms and programming, I always look for opportunities
                                to find innovative technical solutions. 
                                <br><br>
                                <b>Currently, I am pursuing Master's degree focused in Computer Science from Virginia Tech.</b>
